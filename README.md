# GIGACHAT - React Native Chat App

## Project Overview

Gigachat is a collaborative effort by Bart≈Çomiej Czech, Mateusz Warzecha and Piotr Lehmann. It is a modern and user-friendly chat application developed as a university project, using React Native. It showcases our skills in mobile app development and demonstrates our ability to work as a group.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Gigachat allows users to engage in real-time conversations, enabling seamless communication with friends and colleagues. You can even see that the other person is typing!

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the app's features.

- **Search Functionality:** A search feature allows users to quickly find and navigate through their chats.

- **Responsive Design:** Gigachat is designed to provide a consistent and enjoyable user experience across iOS and Android devices (unfortunately, as the company discovered only later on, one's gotta pay 99 bucks yearly in order to be able to create apps for iOS. So, you guessed it, the company resigned from investing in this branch of the market... U won't find Gigachat for iOS.).

## Technologies Used

We utilized a range of technologies and tools to create Gigachat, including:

- **React Native:** The app is built using React Native, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for both iOS and Android.

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as the database for real-time data storage, user authentication, and push notifications.

- **ChakraUI:** We used Chakra UI for the app's user interface components, allowing for a sleek and responsive design.

- **React Navigation:** The app uses React Navigation for seamless navigation and routing within the application.
